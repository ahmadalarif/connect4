SEI_10 First Project - Connect 4 Game


Project description:
This is a static page Connect Four game using HTML, CSS , and Javascript (jQuery) to create.

Game Objective: This is a two player game where players take turns dropping colored discs onto the game board. A player wins when they place 4 discs of their color in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

Game Features:
• This game is fully playable.
• It will automatically throw an alert when a player wins, and it will tell you which player (Red or yellow) won the game.
• The game can be reset by using the reset button. This will clear the board, and maintain the order of players.
• If the game is won by either player then the reset button becomes a New Game button.
• Text above the board will tell the players who's turn it is (color).
• The game is responsive and will shrink to fit tablet and cell phone.

Unsolved problems:
• There is a problem in the stopping the counter after fulfilling the board, for saving the time i will solve it later on.
• I need to add the a high lighter to illuminate when the player turn is changed.

Winner notifecation:
The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own discs,
the owner will be alerted that he or she owns the game.
